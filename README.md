**Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration
A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly**

Introduction: The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.

Steps: *Data extraction: Cloning the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and storing it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.

*Data transformation: Using Python, Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data which may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

*Database insertion: Inserting the data from Python to connect to a SQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands. (MySQL, Postgres SQL, SQLite, any database).

*Dashboard creation: Using the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.

*Data retrieval: Using the sqlconnector to fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe.

*Deployment: Deploying the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users for visualizing the insights obtained from the data.

Conclusion: The result of this project is a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository.
